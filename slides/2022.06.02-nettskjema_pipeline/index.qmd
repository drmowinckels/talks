## What do we collect?

-   questionnaires answered by participants themselves

-   data punched by our staff (like from cognitive testing)

-   logs entered by our staff (like logs from MRI, EEG, VR etc)

-   computer tasks (mirror tracing task sends data to TSD via nettskjema)

-   files uploaded by our partners (Vitas send results from DBS through nettskjema)

## Why do we use it?

-   anyone with a smartphone and internet can access forms to input data (i.e. we can use it "on the go", for instance at the scanner)

-   data entry can be standardised, so that there is less possibility to enter incorrect or impossible data

-   data is sent directly to TSD, so the data is always secure and is not easily lost

-   we dont have issues with multiple people working on the same local file, locking it for editing by others

## Where do they go?

-   Almost all are connected directly to TSD, and are sent to p23 in encrypted safe form on a per response basis.

-   The encrypted data is stored at `/tsd/p23/data/durable/nettskjema-submissions/5xxx/` , where each form has its own subfolder

    -   We need to decrypt and store the data elsewhere for further use

## How can I access the data?

There are two basic ways of interacting with the incoming nettskjema data:

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
**Nettquick**

-   Makes the form data available almost immediately

-   Makes no changes to the data

-   Data stored in a temporary database

## How can I access the data?

There are two basic ways of interacting with the incoming nettskjema data:

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
**Nettskjema pipeline**

-   Slower (runs every couple of hours)

-   Replaces hash-keys with IDs and has a system for correcting errors

-   Data stored in files

::: {.column width="30%"}

## Pipeline in short

-   Single response data come in encrypted to TSD

-   Files are copied to a new safe location

    -   `/tsd/p23/data/durable/nettskjema-submissions/cleaned`

-   Data are decrypted

-   Single responses are combined into larger data set

-   Ids replace the SHA hash keys (suffix `wids)`

-   Edits are applied from `edits-xxxxx.json` (suffix `ed` )

## Pipeline is run as services

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
LCBC nettskjema services

-   run on timers

-   All based in R

-   services run:

    -   nettskjema_decrypt

    -   nettskjema_flag_depression

    -   nettskjema_ids2consent

    -   nettskjema_merge\_\[project\]
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/services.png)
:::
:::

## What are these merge things?

-   Each project (and wave in most cases) get their own merge script

-   These merge all nettskjemas for that project to a large file

    -   for error and data incompatibility checks

    -   These also produce the overview and inconsistent files found in the data inspector

-   This data forms the basis of all data that get entered into the NOAS from nettskjema

## What is the data inspector?

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/datainspector.png)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
![](img/datainspector_table.png)
:::
:::

## What if there are problems with the nettskjema data?

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/nettfix.png)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   An application to alter nettskjema data that are incorrect
    -   usually only used for correcting Ids, Birthdates and sex
-   If data is already in the NOAS, then fixing it on Nettfix will not fix the data
    -   we are working on another application for that
    -   Currently, notify Mo of errors for a manual fix for NOAS
:::
:::

## So, what happens then?

-   Any correction in a nettskjema, is stored in an edits file for that specific nettskjema

    -   edits-xxxx.json

-   It logs the change, a comment and the timestamp of the change

-   If the same element is changed multiple times, a history log of the changes is also created.

-   The nettskjema decrypt service will apply the changes next time it runs

## How does nettskjema data end up in NOAS?

-   Happens with human interaction

    -   this cannot be fully automated, all data entering the NOAS has a human making sure the data is OK to enter there

-   The process may depend on the project, but in general, a script is made to split up the data into NOAS-compatible tables

## Pipeline in short

-   Single response data come in encrypted to TSD

-   Files are copied to a new safe location

    -   `/tsd/p23/data/durable/nettskjema-submissions/cleaned`

-   Data are decrypted

-   Single responses are combined into larger data set

-   Ids replace the SHA hash keys (suffix `wids)`

-   Edits are applied from `edits-xxxxx.json` (suffix `ed` )
