# Series inspiration

ways of working I see, make
- it hard for me to help
- loosing track of the work easily
- loosing vital project files or output easily


<br>

Great rOpenSci community call on reproducible research
  - see [video and materials](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-07-30/)
  - see it when you can, it's 50 minutes with lots of great perspectives

# Series inspiration

[Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan)'s blogpost on [workflow vs. scripts](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) in R
> If the first line of your R script is  
> `setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")`  
> I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE 🔥.  
> 
> If the first line of your R script is  
> `rm(list = ls())`  
> I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE 🔥.

# Why do we care about project management (in R)?

.pull-left[
**Portability**  
_The ability to move the project without breaking code or needing adapting_
  - you will change computers
  - you will reorganise your file structure
  - you will share your code with others
]

--

.pull-right[
**Reproducibility**  
_The ability to rerun the entire process from scratch_
  - not just for reviews
  - not just for best-practice science
  - also for future (or even present) you
  - and for your collaborators/helpers

&nbsp; _Part III_ &nbsp; Package / Library management  
&nbsp; _Part IV_  &nbsp; git & GitHub crash course!

# Self-contained projects

--

.pull-left[
Contains all necessary files for an analysis/paper
  - data
  - results
  - documentation
  - scripts
  - even manuscript!
  
Does not have to be an RStudio project, though that is what we are covering here.
]

--

.pull-right[
Does not use
  - `setwd()`
    - all paths are relative
  - `rm(list = ls())`
    - all files are created to be run in a fresh R session
  - `install.packages()`
    - does not automatically install packages on behalf of the user
  - R behaviour set to:
    - never save environment on exit
    - never load previous environment when opening R
]

---

## Portability
### What’s wrong with `setwd()`?

- It will only ever work for the user creating the file
  - TSD is an exception here, but we won't delve into that now

--

- It is not portable
  - Moving the folder/file will break the code
  - Collaborators will need to change any `setwd` path

--

- Increases likelihood that work from other R processes leaks into current work

.pull-left[
## Portability - The [here package](https://here.r-lib.org/)
- If all files are contained in the project folder
- reference files with the `here()` function from the here-package
  - creates relative paths from project root
  - allows several ways to indicate project root folder if not working with RStudio

## Portability - example My talks project

**Project root**
```{r}
library(here)
here()
```

**Build path to the slide file**
```{r}
here("slides/2022.02.03-rproj/index.Rmd")
```

**List all files in project root**
```{r}
list.files(here())
```

---

## Portability - Folder/File structure

.pull-left[
- data
  - all raw data files, organised in meaningful ways
  - never, ever write _back_ to this folder, read only
  - if using git, never commit to history, place in `.gitignore`
- results
  - write all analysis etc. results to
  - treat as disposable, can be overwritten
  - may also include figures etc if wanted
]

.pull-right[
- docs
  - documentation
  - Rmarkdown files
- R
  - if you write functions that are used in several places
  - this is the standard R folder for keeping these files that might be called with `source()` calls
- scripts/analysis
  - files with full analysis pipelines
  - might have `source` calls to files in R
]

---

## Portability - Folder/File structure

.pull-left[
- README.Rmd/README.md
   - markdown file describing the project content and intent
   - maybe also explains which files to look in for what
   - ideal to have if saving the folder to github
- DESCRIPTION
  - R specific file with information about the project
  - can be created with `rrtools::use_compendium()`
  - covered later in the series
]

--

.pull-right[
**if you plan on putting it online (github)**
- LICENCE
  - dictates how code can be reused
  - not covering that in this series, ask me at need
- CITATION
  - gives users/readers a clear instruction on how to cite if they use the code
  - not covering that in this series, ask me at need, or read on [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files)
]

## Reproducibility
### What's wrong with `rm(list = ls())`?

--
- only removes _visible_ objects in the R environment
--

- all libraries remain loaded
  - i.e. you loaded a library without writing the library call in your script, you cannot rerun the process from scratch
  - libraries need to be loaded in the same sequence to avoid unintended masking of functions
--

- all hidden objects remain loaded
  - all objects starting with a `.` like `.data` remain
--

- any R options that might have been changed remain changed
  - options changed through `options()` like `options(straingsAsFactors = FALSE)` will remain. If this is not documented in the script, then it wont run in a fresh instance

---

## Reproducibility - Things should be run in fresh R sessions

- User-level setup
  - Don't save `.RData`on exit, or load it on startup
  - `Tools` -> `Global options` -> `General`
  - Running R from command line   
    save in `.bashrc` `alias R='R --no-save --no-restore-data'`
- Don't put things in `.Rprofile` that affect how R code runs
- Work habits
  - Restart R often (I do it almost every 10 minutes)
  - From RStudio: `Session` -> `Restart R` OR `ctrl/cmd + shift + F10`
  - In shell: `ctrl + D` to exit R, then restart R

## Reproducibility
# The source code is real

Everything in your working environment _at all times_ should be made by the source code. 

--

You ensure this by restarting the R sessions often, to catch when you might have made changes that stop you from reproducing the environment.

--

You remember what you did 5 minutes ago, but you wont remember it in 2 days.


---

## Reproducibility

### What about output that takes a long time to create?

--

- Should be isolated to their own scripts and run on demand/need
- Should write files to the `results` folder, either as text files or `.rds`/`.RData` files
- Then other files can access this output data for further use, rather than need to rerun it every time

---

## Reproducibility
### What's wrong with `install.packages`?

- Don't force the person running your script to install packages without their expressed intent
- Some might have strictly curated libraries and need versions to remain stable
- You can include `install.packages` in scripts as long as you have a hash/comment in front of it `# install.packages()`
- we will later in the series discuss alternate ways of dealing with package dependencies of your project

# Project workflows

- All necessary files contained in the project and referenced relatively

--

- All necessary outputs are created by code in the project

--

- All code can be run in fresh sessions and produce the same output

--

- Does not force other users to alter their own work setup
