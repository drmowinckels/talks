# Why should you bother with R?

--

.pull-left[
## You don't have to...

- None of your colleagues use R

- You are happy with the software you know

- You can create transparent and reproducible workflows in the tools you already know

]

--

.pull-right[
## But you might like to
- create familiar ways of working in R for colleagues

- help colleagues start working more transparently and reproducibly

- take advantage of the huge repertoire of packages to aid in almost any statistical endeavour

]

???
And R can these days do much more than statistics, though it is fast becoming a very popular tool with data scientist.
R is often quite popular in the social sciences, and in my opinion better options that Stata or SPSS, which are usually taught.

# It sounds like lots of work...

--

- does require initial efforts to get into a package format
    - utilise all the packages available to help you create, test, distribute and document your package

--

- well-documented and stable functions reduce long-term maintenance and need of explanations to colleagues already familiar with working in R

--

- unit tests of package functionality can alert you to changes in R or package dependencies that break core package functionality
    - or to protect from future you making breaking changes

# Talk outline

- Identify and assess staff needs
- Key helper packages
- Take a look at an in-house package
- Distributing packages
   - locally
   - online

# Identify and assess staff needs

--

.pull-left[
## Identify
- What are the things they often ask you for help on?

- What are the things you observe them doing in very manual and tedious ways?

- What operations require customised handling for your data/tasks?
]

--

.pull-right[
## Assess
- Is R the best tool to deal with this?

- What is the user level proficiency?

- What operating systems are people working on?

- How are people used to working in R?

# OK, cool, cool. How do I develop?

???
you have mainly two developer IDE's to choose from: RStudio and vscode.
I use RStudio, it has a lot of functionality that helps develop packages and functions efficiently, and start checks and builds. 
I've never personally used vscode for R, but have colleagues who have for general R use, but not for package dev, so I can't really say anything for or against it.
I'll be using RStudio, and so you can see the process and how the IDE helps me be more efficient.

# Key helper packages

- [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) to help set-up pacakge
  - licences, github actions, online documentation
- [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) inline function documentation
- [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package loading, checking, building
- [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) unit testing
- [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) package documentation as vignettes/tutorials

# Example package

# Distributing packages

.pull-left[

 - CRAN
  - requires diligence and patience
  - [follow steps carefully](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/prepare-for-cran)
- GitHub
  - `remotes::install_github("user/repo")`
  - will not compile for all users, can be tricky on networked windows
]

.pull-right[

- [R-universe](https://ropensci.org/r-universe/) by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)
  - [Jeroen Ooms keynote at UseR!2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cv2qsZ_xZw&list=PL4IzsxWztPdmHoJwIVa4um44w2GMjctmP&index=8)
  - Builds package binaries, no need to install extra packages
  - Example: LCBC's [ggseg](https://ggseg.r-universe.dev/ui#builds) universe
  - Subscribe to the [rOpenSci newsletter](https://ropensci.org/news/)
]

- locally
  - building a package creates a `tar.gz` file that can be used to install.
