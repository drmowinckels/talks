# Building a website for a global community

--

- That relies on volunteer effort

  - of the developer

  - of the translators

--

- That minimizes costs

  - in money
  
  - in volunteer hours

- That looks professional
  
  - user and accessibility friendly
  
  - can be translated

# Building a website for a global community

.pull-left[
## Open-source

- The entire source code of the new website is on [GitHub](https://github.com/rladies/website)

- The website is built using Hugo, Netlify, and GitHub actions

- Allows contributions (pull-requests) from anyone, merged through code review

    - allows volunteers to contribute translations
    
    - allows volunteers to contribute blog posts
    
    - allows volunteers to suggest improvements
    
    - gives credit to all who have contributed (through contributors list)

.pull-right[
## Higher technical bias

- Means harder entry for beginners

- Necessitates good documentation 

- Guiding those who want to contribute through the process and technicalities if they are unfamiliar with them

- Creating a community where people are comfortable asking for help, if they want to contribute
