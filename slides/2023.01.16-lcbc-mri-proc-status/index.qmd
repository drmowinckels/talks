## What is the issue?

::: incremental
-   How do we keep track of the MRI data?

    -   What is the expected processing pipeline for a specific dataset?

-   How do we know what are possible issues with an MRI dataset?

-   Where do we look for this information?

    -   How easily can new and existing staff find the information they are after?

-   How can we update this information?
:::

## How do we keep track?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Problem**

MRI has many processing steps

-   Many steps must be done in a serial fashion.

-   Knowing which step is next can be difficult

-   Knowing if any steps have failed and why is difficult
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Need**

A system that:

-   tracks step progression

<!-- -->

-   indicates expected pipeline to follow
:::
:::

## How do we know possible issues with a dataset?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Problem**

MRI data are highly annotated

-   Issues at scanner

-   Issues in import

-   Issues in processing

-   Stored project-wise in spreadsheets

    -   Can only be edited by one person at the time
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Need**

A system that:

-   Gathers all annotations to the same place

-   Classifies them into meaningful categories

    -   i.e. belonging to certain modularities

-   Makes it possible to edit annotations
:::
:::

## Where is this information?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Problem**

-   Project-specific logging

    -   distributed in many files

    -   no logic in location

-   Stored in spreadsheets

    -   Only one can edit

    -   Gets locked and then copied

    -   Each has unique organisation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Need**

A system that:

-   Collects all logs for all projects

-   Has a standardised way of storing data

    -   also allowing for project specific setups

-   Allows multiple users to interact with it
:::
:::

## How do we update?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Problem**

Updates to the logs are 100% manual

-   Who does it?

-   Who has the newest information?

-   How do they do it?

-   What is the newest information?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Need**

A system that:

-   allows manual and automatic update of information

-   creates easy visual representations to check what has been done

-   is the single source of needed information

## Future work

**Application**

-   API endpoints

    -   task.json

    -   protocol.json

-   Streamline code more

-   Switch from GET to POST where appropriate
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pipeline integration**

-   Get comments and ratings from nettskjema

-   Integrate with MRI rating application

-   Have pipelines update the jsons when tasks finish/fail

-   Populate for all legacy data
