## Why do we use TSD?

::: incremental
-   The only Norwegian service that provide storage of black (sensitive) data

-   Also connected to a computing cluster for heavy computational loads

-   Service is affordable, compared to other possible cloud computing and storage systems
:::

## What are the challenges?

::: incremental
-   Staff are unfamiliar with Linux

-   The general file structure and navigation is unfamiliar

-   The lack of "simple" UI tools makes it hard for junior staff to do certain tasks

-   Access is slow and laggy

-   Keyboard mappings are not always correct/as expected

-   Old operating systems makes some tools hard to get working
:::

::: notes
-   We spend lots of time to get even the most "basic" analysis pipelines going, as we need to custom build many of them

-   Containers are great to work around these things, but updating containers is also a challenge and are especially unfamiliar territory for almost all staff
:::

## What do we use TSD for?

::: incremental
Almost everything

-   data storage

-   analysis/computing

-   data validation / quality assertion

-   data logging

-   software development

# Getting data in to TSD

## How does data get into TSD?

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
::: incremental
-   [**Nettskjema**](https://nettskjema.no/)

    -   Telephone interviews

    -   Questionnaires

    -   Data entered by our staff

    -   Logs entered by our staff

    -   Computer tasks

    -   File uploads

::: incremental
-   [**S3 bucket**](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/sensitive-data/help/import-export.html#import-export-via-command-line-through-API)

    -   Larger files, like MRI / genetics etc

-   [**Data portal**](https://data.tsd.usit.no/)

    -   Most day-to-day imports of smaller files

## Why do we use Nettskjema so actively?

::: incremental
-   anyone with a smartphone and internet can access forms to input data (i.e. we can use it "on the go")
-   data entry can be standardised, so that there is less possibility to enter incorrect or impossible data
-   data is sent directly to TSD, so the data is always secure and is not easily lost
-   we don't have issues with multiple people working on the same local file, locking it for editing by others
-   data can enter TSD by staff/partners without TSD access

# Working inside TSD

## 

## [TSD userland services](https://github.com/f-krull/tuls) (TULS)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
-   All users like to have UI components to work with

-   Admin team set up tools:

    -   **service-user**: for general tools or run pipelines for general purpose

    -   **service-machine**: services run on dedicated VM

## [**Gitea**](https://gitea.io/en-us/) **- Git with a cup of tea**

::: columns
::: {.column width="25%"}
-   GitHub/GitLab like server inside TSD

-   Having a git server inside TSD aids clean collaboration

-   Syncing repos between GitHub/Gitea is cleaner

## Our data-base

## Example of MRI data checking tool

</video>

## Tools

-   Admins/Managers install various tools in common user folders

-   Set up distinct alias'es for accessing these tools & path shortcuts

-   Users are recommended to source aliases into their `.barshrc` for easy access

    -   Can at times collide with system set-ups by USIT or the Colossus `module` system

    -   Needs to be done sparingly

# What can TSD improve for the end users?

::: incremental
-   Increased communication with users to inform development

-   An online user forum to connect users

-   [RStudio Package Manager](https://www.rstudio.com/products/package-manager/) for R and python
:::

::: notes
-   Development focus on user experience

    -   New tools/infrastructure for TSD are being developed

    -   Little funding/flash in improving existing infrastructure and user experience

    -   We have never received a survey on user experience of TSD

-   A user forum to connect users

    -   Currently, there is no way to chat/report issues on TSD-use other than the UiO IT ticket system

    -   An online user forum could get users in touch with each other and help each other solve issues in a more transparent way

    -   IT tickets of the same kind are likely being solved over and over again, while an online forum could have the solution once, and users could find it

    -   Users find quicker answers, IT get less ticket burden

-   RStudio package manager could ease access to R packages inside TSD, both for R and python.

    -   our experience is that R package installs and python environments are extremely tricky get working as the users expect, and both our admin team, staff, and USIT spend a lot of time getting these things working.
